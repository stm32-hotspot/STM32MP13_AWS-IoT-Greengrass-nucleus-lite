# Setting up Greengrass Lite

See the [build guide](INSTALL.md) to compile Greengrass Lite. You do not need to
install it.

Greengrass Lite executables will be available under `bin` in the build
directory.

When run, they may use the current working directory to store state. Use the
directory you intend to use as the Greengrass root path.

The following examples assume you are using `./build` as the build directory,
and `./run` as the Greengrass root path.

## Configuring Greengrass

To configure Greengrass, you will need a config YAML file, in the same format as
the Classic nucleus config. An example config file is available in
[`doc/examples/sample_nucleus_config.yml`](examples/sample_nucleus_config.yml).
If this is the first time you are creating a GG device, please follow the
instruction in the [TES setup instructions](./TES.md) to get a role alias,
thing, certificate, private key, and endpoints for your device.

Make a copy of the [sample configuration](./examples/sample_nucleus_config.yml).

Configure the following in your config file

- privateKeyPath: Path to private key for the Thing
- certificateFilePath: Path to Thing certificate
- thingName: Name of the Thing
- rootPath: Absolute path to the Greengrass rootpath directory
- awsRegion: The AWS region with the Thing
- iotCredEndpoint: The IoT Core endpoint
- iotDataEndpoint: The IoT Core endpoint
- posixUser: Colon separated user/group that generic components should run as
- iotRoleAlias: The name of the role alias for accessing TES

`posixUser` must be set to a valid user and group. If no colon and group is
provided, the user's default group is used. If not running Greengrass as root,
set this to the user Greengrass is running as.

The following examples assume you have made a copy in `./run/init_config.yml`
and configured the required fields in it.

To load the config, you will need to run the config daemon and run the
configuration script.

In one shell, run the config daemon:

```sh
cd ./run
../build/bin/ggconfigd
```

In another shell, run the config script

```sh
cd ./run
../build/bin/ggl-config-init --config ./init_config.yml
```

You can then kill the config daemon.

If you already have a Greengrass Lite system running, and want to update the
config values, you don't need to run another copy of the config daemon, just run
`ggl-config-init`.

## Running the nucleus

To run all the Greengrass Lite core services for testing, enter a working dir
and run `run_nucleus`:

```sh
cd ./run
../build/bin/run_nucleus
```

## Performing a local deployment

To do a local deployment with the Greengrass Lite CLI, you will need a directory
with the component's recipe and a directory with the component's artifacts. See
the Greengrass component documentation for writing your own Greengrass
component.

Assuming you place these in `~/sample-component`, and that your component has a
single artifact named `hello_world.py`, the layout should be similar to the
following:

```
~/sample-component
├── artifacts
│   └── com.example.SampleComponent
│       └── 1.0.0
│           └── hello_world.py
└── recipes
    └── com.example.SampleComponent-1.0.0.yaml
```

With the above, you can start a local deployment with:

```sh
./build/bin/ggl-cli deploy --recipe-dir ~/sample-component/recipes \
  --artifacts-dir ~/sample-component/artifacts \
  --add-component SampleComponent=1.0.0
```

## Using the CloudLogger component

The [aws.greengrass.CloudLogger component README](../cloud-logger/README.md)
contains instructions for using CloudLogger. This is a generic component which
uploads system logs to cloudwatch.
