Then follow the instructions for setup and testing from the aws-greengrass-lite-2024-10-22/docs directory, SETUP.md. Attached.

Edit the init_config.yml to reflect your setup, including paths to certificates on the STM32MP1 - no HSM or pkcs11 support currently. Load the config as detailed in SETUP.md.

scp sample-component.gz root@<BOARD_IP>/home/root/.
tar xvf sample-component.gz

Then from the run directory:
